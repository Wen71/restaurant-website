# Restaurant website
## Font
For the style of the website, we use [font awesome](https://www.w3schools.com/icons/fontawesome_icons_intro.asp). No installation is needed. To see the real UI design, you may need to download the live server extension. Click on extension tab in visual studio code and search for live server and then download it.
